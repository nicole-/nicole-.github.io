								<img src="rider-waite/tarotChariot.jpg"/>
									<div class="meaning">
										The Chariot represents conquest, victory and overcoming opposition through your confidence and control. Any success will be a result of applying these factors to the situation. You will need to use the strength of your willpower to overcome any obstacles or challenges in your way. You may even find that by leveraging any opposing forces surrounding you at this time you can use them to your advantage. You must be determined, self-disciplined, and hard working. If you are, you will triumph over any difficulties or anyone who is trying to limit you. This struggle will ultimately make you stronger.</div>

							<figure class="fig major" id="figDeath">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotDeath.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">
									Death does not necessarily, or even usually, indicate physical death. In fact, in general, it is considered irresponsible for readers to predict physical death, as we are creatures with free will, and such things are not written in stone. This card simply indicates transformation and change. This is definitely a time of deep transformation, likely to be both inner and outwardly in your life. Situations, things, and people that you have counted on or gotten used to may no longer be available to you in quite the same way as they once were, and this transition can be difficult for some people. Keyword: transformation.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figDevil">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotDevil.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The Devil is not as frightening a card to interpret as the depiction on most cards indicates. It is a card about bondage but often this bondage is metaphoric and internal. With this card  you are called to look beyond superficial appearances and to go deeper into the truth and meaning of a situation. You also are asked to remember that  when you're feeling restrained you nearly always hold the keys to your own freedom. Don't give up hope! Keeping a positive mindset is of the utmost importance right now. Positive affirmations are important and will benefit you. Take a look at who you surround yourself with. Are there upbeat, positive people around you?

							<figure class="fig major" id="figEmpress">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotEmpress.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The Empress is an archetype of feminine power; she is watery, hard to fathom, mysterious, fertile, and sexual. She augurs a need for us to be in touch with our feminine side, to listen to our intuition, and to give priority to our emotions an passions. She can signify coming abundance. People are going to be more attracted to you than usual (in every sense) and you are likely to find people on your doorstep, wanting your advice/your shoulder to cry on. This will be beneficial to you because you are now going to be able to see yourself more in the way that others see you - as someone with wisdom, and a lot to offer. So share your perspectives.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figEmporer">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotEmporer.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The Emperor shows us that domination of the mind over the heart is sometimes not wanted, but in some cases is it necessary and even welcomed, and that this is part of what we must think about when he appears. When hard choices must be made it's important to maintain your concentration and focus, and this is something this time period will make it easy for you to do. Enjoy the assertiveness and confidence it that this self-control and focus brings. Forge ahead and do what you know is best. If you can master yourself then you should have little problem mastering the world and all the things in it.</div>

							<figure class="fig major" id="figHanged">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotHanged.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The Hanged Man generally shows that you are at a crossroads - one with only two options i.e. in or out, up or down, yes or no. You may find yourself very much wanting to do "something" but having no idea what it is or how to do it. If that happens, that's a clear sign that you should stop, relax, and look at ways that you might need to let go of attempts to control life/situations/people/things. It's possible that there is an outdated attitude or wish that you need to let go of. Any sacrifice that you make will open up your life to something even more positive than what you "let go of."

							<figure class="fig major" id="figHermit">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotHermit.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">When questions about the nature of existence and the purpose of life start eating away at your mind, answers will not be found in the physical world. They can only be found inside of you. You have risen above your desires and emotions because they will no longer help you on your journey. Now you must become like the Hermit, who seeks the answers alone. Only the whispers of his Inner Voice, and the light of his lamp, will guide him now. Eventually even that lamp shall be cast away, because it is artificial and will not help the Hermit forever. His own inner light must learn to shine in the absence of the light of others.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figHierophant">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotHierophant.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">Spirit is the final leg of the triad that has been previously seen in the Empress and Emperor; the archetype of the spiritual world is the Hierophant. This is the card of beliefs, both religious and otherwise, though it does tend to focus on the religious and spiritual aspects because the Hierophant himself is often depicted as a holy man. Indeed, in some decks this card is known as the Pope or High Priest. But in actuality, a Hierophant is a person who holds 'forbidden' or 'secret' knowledge. While this could easily apply to the clergy, it has far greater scope than this. In a way it could be said that (with apologies to Crowley) every person is a Hierophant.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figHierophant">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotHighPriestess.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The High Priestess is arguably the most difficult of the Major Arcana to qualify with words alone, because so much of her power and ability is veiled in mystery that it is difficult for anyone to fathom it all. Every card in the Tarot speaks differently to everyone, but the Priestess seems to bear the widest range of interpretations, because she speaks directly to the Inner Voice, the unconscious mind. She is the manifestation of the unconscious and the effects of the mysterious in our everyday world. Trying to see how such mysteries work often defeats their purpose, and with this in mind, the High Priestess will be explained in as much detail as possible.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figJudgement">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotJudgement.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The card originally known as Judgement Day derives from Christian scripture, but in most religions and cultures there is the concept of spiritual rebirth after the end of the world. This is another card of transition, like Death and the Tower, but its energy is neither violent nor catastrophic despite the fact that its power is far greater. This is the energy of creation without destruction, impossible on the material plane but certainly possible in the world of the spirit. There is rebirth not through discarding negativity, but through integration of all parts of the self. The spirit is cleansed and restored without loss or addition. It remains the same, but different.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figJustice">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotJustice.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">Since the Major Arcana do not apply directly to physical life, it must follow that Justice does not apply to the laws made by mankind. True, sometimes the laws of mankind mimic the laws that Justice does enforce, and in those rare cases Justice can indeed refer to them. But Justice typically refers to the immutable laws of the Universe, the invisible principles that keep everything flowing forward smoothly through infinite causal chains. These are laws that cannot be violated; only enforced. And the sword of Justice, double-edged as always, is ready to mete out punishment for those who have wronged, and to reward those who have done good deeds.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figLovers">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotLovers.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The Lovers card is not just about love and sexuality; it has several meanings which are all related to the duality expressed in the image of the card. The image of the two lovers holding hands or intertwined is a powerful symbol for the harmonious union of two beings, but it also stands for the necessity of proper choice, and some interesting concepts about the relationship of our conscious minds to whatever power brings these lovers together. It should be apparent that, in our culture which has so many words and definitions for the simple emotion of love, the image of love as expressed in the Tarot can have so many meanings.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figMagician">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotMagician.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The Magician's number is One, the number of creation and individuality; his power is transformation through the use of his will. In his manipulation of the basic elements into all the substances and materials of life, he shows us that from a foundation of the mundane can emerge all that is to come. He can take the Nothing from which the Fool emerged and shape it into Something, making one out of zero. Clearly this is power of a divine sort, and it is true that the Magician is a conduit for a higher power, which commands all of the material world. Since all that we can see in the physical world is the conduit himself, the acts he performs often seem like magic.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figMoon">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotMoon.jpg"/><div class="meaning">It has been said many times that things are not always as they seem, and in the influence of the Moon this axiom is particularly true. In the moonlight, things that are benevolent during the day can suddenly seem dangerous and malicious. The very term "moonlight" is misleading because the Moon does not emit light of its own, it simply reflects the light of the Sun. Some people even claim to see the face of a man on the Moon's cratered surface, though of course such a thing is impossible and only an illusion. A lot of people who look for that face in the Moon know it could not be there, but they look nonetheless.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figStar">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotStar.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">Whenever all hope seems lost, it will reappear to prove that you have really lost nothing, except perhaps your sight of the path to enlightenment. And in the absence of that sight, the Star will light your way. Its light is not a blinding flash like the lightning bolt of the Tower, but a soft radiating glow that warms and comforts, rather than burning and destroying. You must remember that both of these energies ultimately come from the same place in the sky - from Heaven. After the light of the Tower destroys the false path you were following, the kinder and gentler light of the Star will lead you back to the right path.

								<h3>The Star</h3>

						<article>
							<figure class="fig major" id="figStrength">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotStrength.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The title of this card is often misleading because most people tend to think of strength as a property of the physical body. But this is not a card of brute force, because none of the Major Arcana apply directly to the physical body. These are cards of ideas, feeling and beliefs; trying to make a Major Arcanum depicting someone strong of body would be a pointless exercise. But strength is not always measured in terms of how much you can lift or how fast you can run. True Strength is fortitude of character, and the ability to not only control the emotions, but to rise above them, and triumph over all out lower impulses and desires.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figSun">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotSun.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The Sun symbolizes many things depending on how you look at it. The ancients saw the sun as the giver of life and light, and almost every polytheistic faith has a Sun God. It brings light and clarity after a period of darkness and confusion, and in this sense the Sun God is often a redeemer as well; a bringer of peace and good times after ordeals. Finally, the Sun is a symbol of steadfastness and reliability, for no matter how bleak your situation may seem, no matter how many problems you have, the Sun will still rise in the morning. All of these attributions, and more, are reflected in the Tarot card that bears the same name as our solitary star.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figTemperance">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotTemperance.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">After the purging experience of Death, it is necessary to rebuild and improve on that which has been left over. Now that old habits and beliefs are gone forever, new attitudes must be acquired to fill the gaps and make you whole again. This process of reconstruction and harmonization is shown by the card called Temperance. The verb "to temper" means to modify or strengthen by adding a new component to an existing substance or mixture, and this broad defintion can be applied to many areas of your life. But all applications of Temperance share the common theme of moderation and balance, culminating in the creation of a centered and well-rounded being.

								<h3>Temperance</h3>

							<figure class="fig major" id="figTower">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotTower.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">Sometimes, when accepted and welcomed, divine wisdom and enlightenment flow freely like a calm river. The rest of the time, wisdom is blocked until it rages forth like a tidal wave and crushes anything in its path, including the recipient of the wisdom. This is the energy of the Tower card, an energy very similar to Death in that it is both a destructive and a creative force. When a building is old and decrepit, it must be demolished so that a new structure may stand in its place. The same is true of the symbolic Tower. When old attitudes and beliefs are outdated, you will have to let go of them, whether you like it or not.

							<figure class="fig major" id="figWheel">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotWheel.jpg"/><div class="meaning">The Wheel of Fortune is a type of energy that stands beyond the realm of our understanding and control. Certainly you can experience its effects in life, like you feel the pull of gravity on your body. But just as you can see the apple falling but not the gravity pulling on it, so too are the works of Fate and Destiny invisible to us. Only their results can be seen, and even then, only when Destny itself decrees that the time is right for its effects to be manifested. Unlike the majority of the Major Arcana, the Wheel of Fortune hovers in the clouds, showing that you can try to reach it, but that you can never fully understand it.

								<h3>The Wheel</h3>

							<figure class="fig major" id="figWorld">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotWorld.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">After every obstacle has been faced and surmounted, after every path has been travelled and charted, there remains only the last step to the next level of existence - the World, the final gateway. After the union of the conscious and unconscious, the mind and the body, in Judgement, all that can remain is union with the Divine in whatever form it appears to you. This journey is over and the next is only beginning. The cycle is complete as last, with the vindication of the traveler and the immortality he has gained through development of the self. It would seem that the Fool's Journey may not have been so foolish after all.

								<h3>The World</h3>

						<article>
							<figure class="fig major" id="figFool">
								<img src="rider-waite/tarotFool.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">Without the notion of Zero, our system of mathematics becomes meaningless. Similarly, the Fool is an essential part of the Tarot because he is the spark that sets everything else into motion, the divine breath that gives life and inspires the first step towards fulfillment and completion. Though the first step down a long path may often seem small in comparison to the journey, that first step is vital because without it there would be no journey at all! The Fool is the cause behind all effects, the power behind all manifestations and the seeds of the end sown in every beginning.

							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsAce">
								<img src="rider-waite/wandsAce.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The Ace of Wands is the initial burst of creativity and outpouring of energy that energizes a project and inspires people to greatness. This is the spark that starts the fire, and though it cannot tell us whether the fire will burn brightly or fizzle out, its power remains. The symbology of the castle and the river on the Rider-Waite variants tells you that the Ace of Wands is like a torch that can guide you to success. However, you must be willing to carry the torch with you as you travel along that winding stream to happiness. The Ace cannot tell you where to go, but it can light your way so you can make the correct choices yourself.
								</div>
								<h3>Ace of Wands</h3>
							</figure>
						</article>
							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsTwo">
								<img src="rider-waite/wands2.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">
									After the initial power of the Ace enters your life, that power must be shaped and directed towards the area in your life where it will be most useful. This is the energy of the Two of Wands, a card of applied power. A cohesive vision of the final destination starts to form, and though this first impression may be incorrect, that really does not matter at this time. There will be plenty of time to change your course later if you are not heading in the direction you want to be. What is important now is to get moving towards your goals, whatever those are
								</div>
								<h3>Two of Wands</h3>
							</figure>
						</article>
						<article>
							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsThree">
								<img src="rider-waite/wands3.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">It seems appropriate that the Three of Wands has three main interpretations, all of which seem to stand alone but which ultimately relate to each other. The first of these is established strength; success after initial hardship and difficulty. Partnership and teamwork is the second theme, particularly leadership in creative environments. This card also deals with personal virtue and respect for oneself. It shows that, when the chips are down and your have no one to help you and, you can turn to yourself for support and you will never be let down.
								</div>
								<h3>Three of Wands</h3>
							</figure>
						</article>
						<article>
							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsFour">
								<img src="rider-waite/wands4.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">
									The applied and established strength of the Two and Three leads to the first stage of completion and rest, shown in the Four of Wands. This is a time to look back on all that you have done and be glad that you have done it. This would seem to very many people like a wholly positive card, but there is a conflict between the dynamic expansion of the Wands and the very restrictive and limiting numnber four. This shows primarily that, while success can be enjoyed for a while, you cannot rest on your laurels. You must never stop growing, learning, and living.
								</div>
								<h3>Four of Wands</h3>
							</figure>
						</article>
						<article>
							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsFive">
								<img src="rider-waite/wands5.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">The Five of Wands shows two types of conflict - outer and inner. The former arises when the world around you is filled with hassles and minor obstacles that would not slow your progress alone, but, when combined, they become increasingly difficult to overcome. The latter meaning manifests in times of difficult ethical choices, when the head fights the heart and when both are in combat with the conscience, each trying to tell you the best way to act and the right thing to do. It can indeed seem that you are being held back and attacked from all sides in such times

						<article>
							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsSix">
								<img src="rider-waite/wands6.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">Six is a number of balance, so it makes sense that the Six of Wands shows a time when the strife and competition of the past have been overcome, and you can enjoy the spoils of victory. This is one of the most powerful of the Minor Arcana since its meaning is so one-sided yet so full of depth at the same time. Though it is a purely physical victory that has been gained, not a spiritual one as in the Sun, that does detract from the momentary pleasure and acclaim. Not every victory must be a spiritual one - victories in the material world as just as enjoyable

						<article>
							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsSeven">
								<img src="rider-waite/wands7.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">This card teaches not only the value of courage, but the value of fear in your everday life. The Seven of Wands in the Rider-Waite variants is shown as a battle, but not one like the Five of Wands where there is no strategy and no cohesion. On the Seven, one man stands tall against all comers, and he will defend his ground until the end. Surely he must be somewhat afraid in the face of six armed foes - any of us would be. But the remarkable thing about the Seven of Wands is that it gives you the power to feel your fear, use your fear and thereby conquer your fear.

						<article>
							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsEight">
								<img src="rider-waite/wands8.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">
									The Eight of Wands is a strange and powerful card, because on many of the decks where the Minor Arcana show picture scenes, there is still nothing on this particular card but the Eight Wands. There are no human figures on the card, and in this aspect only the Aces and the Wheel of Fortune stands with it. (And perhaps the Three of Swords, though this card often shows a heart.) It should come as little surprise that the energy of the Eight of Wands is a swift and rapid one, not that different from the Ace of Wands or even the powerful Wheel of Fortune

							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsNine">
								<img src="rider-waite/wands9.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">
									Inner strength, stamina, and the will to go on despite impossible odds are at the center of the Nine of Wands. But this is not the same card of static defense that is found in the Seven of Wands. The Nine of Wands is more of a dynamic defense, and thus it is much more powerful. Crowley pointed out that this card illustrates the aphorism "change is stability". In times of great difficulty and stress, this card show us that you will always have strength to endure if you search for it deep inside of yourself.

							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsTen">
								<img src="rider-waite/wands10.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">
									It may seem odd that the suit of Wands ends not with the same fiery energy that it started out with, but with almost a complete opposite of that energy. The Ace of Wands was quick and unrestrained, but the Ten shows the weight of burdens upon one's shoulders. Where the rest of the Wands dealt with the creative expression and use of one's willpower, on the Ten this power is blocked, and you are forced to live under someone else's will rather than your own. But there is a logical explanation for this card's appearance at the end of the Wands suit.

								<div class="meaning">
									The Page of Wands has a passion for life, despite the fact (or maybe because of the fact) that he is still a child and his understanding of the world is not yet complete. He is a free spirit, not weighed down by the burdens of the material world, coming and going as he pleases, usually bringing change along for the ride. He is the catalyst that provokes changes that might be impossible in any other situation. When his energy enters your life it may manifest in one of three ways: as a person around you, as an event that you will experience, or as a part of yourself that you must bring to the fore.

								<img src="rider-waite/wandsKnight.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">
									There is no card in the Tarot that portrays such daring and enthusiasm as the Knight of Wands. His energy and courage are boundless, and he has no fear of anything; while this sometimes serves to get him into trouble, these are also the means by which he can free himself from any detrimental situation. There are few times when he does not move with the speed of a flash of lightning. When he rides into the area he always kicks up dust behind him, and when he enters your life he can be one of three things. He could be a person around you, an event that you will experience, or a part of yourself that you must bring to the surface.

							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsQueen">
								<img src="rider-waite/wandsQueen.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">
									Something in the symbology of the Queen of Wands gives us a look into the character of this charming but elusive woman. She is almost universally pictured with a cat, and this feline companion represents Venus in both its creative and sinister aspects. Thus the Queen of Wands is someone who can use for fire energy for good or evil; almost a Swords notion. Her innate Water form and the Fire of her suit cancel out, leaving her very Airy. This energy can appear as a person or as a part of yourself. She hardly ever represents an event in one's life.

							<figure class="fig minor wands" id="wandsKing">
								<img src="rider-waite/wandsKing.jpg"/>
								<div class="meaning">
									The King of Wands is pure fire energy, but strangely enough, he has the least to do with actual creation and creativity. His forte is not in dreaming up ideas and implementing them himself, but in taking an idea and changing the world to match his vision. As such he is a natural leader and commander of all kinds of people. They flock to him to hear what he has to say and leave just as eagerly when he gives them something to do for him. Like the rest of the Kings, the ruler of the Wands suit will appear in two ways in your life: either as a person or as a part of yourself that must be awakened.

								<div class="meaning">The Ace of Pentacles is the foundation for all kinds of projects in the real world; this foundaton is as valuable as gold, and as solid as concrete. It is the cornerstone of a building that might stand for decades, or crumble to dust after a few years - this is determined by how the rest of the structure is put together. The Ace of Pentacles is not the promise of long-lasting financial and material security that some might expect, but it is the sign that such things are within your reach. It gives you the resources to go in search of higher goals.

									The duality of the number Two is particularly strong in the Two of Pentacles because it implies both balance and change, a combination of the inactive and the active that at first seems rather absurd. After all, if something is constantly changing, how can it be kept in balance? Seeing that balance is also a dynamic quality is the key to understanding the energy of the Two of Pentacles. It's like a juggler who keeps his balls in constant motion but always under his control.

Everyone seeks a job that they can enjoy and do well at, and this card shows such careers that are both emotionally and financially fulfilling. It seems that this kind of career is less and less available these days, but the Three of Pentacles shows that some of us can still find such work. These jobs are those which inspire you to work hard, to do your best and to cooperate with others towards the accomplishment of a common goal. They are fulfilling on all levels.

									It is the nature of the Pentacles suit - and indeed, the nature of the human being - to favor tradition and be apprehensive of change. After all, change can upset the security and balance that we are taught to achieve, and once we have found success, shouldn't we try to keep it? Such a philosophy has led to many people staying successful, but it has also led to others losing everything they hoped to preserve. To try and fight change is a task which ultimately proves futile. The fear of loss may certainly prevent loss, but it also prevents further gain.

								<div class="meaning">In a world that equates success with financial security, the loss shown on the Five of Pentacles can be a humbling blow to one's self-esteem. This can be brought about in many ways, but even though an exterior event may seem to be the cause, this card often shows a loss that you bring upon yourself. Even though the Pentacles are a material suit, and Fives usually deal with real-world problems, the theme of poverty is not the true destitution shown on the Five of Pentacles. There is a spiritual loss that often precedes or accompanies loss of material wealth.

								<div class="meaning">The epiphany of Ebeneezer Scrooge, maybe the most profound and sudden change of heart in literature, carries a feeling of generosity very similar to that of the Six of Pentacles. The Six is the dawning of the light after the dark night of the Five, and the realization that material wealth and spiritual wealth are so different after all. The lesson of the Ace has been learned. Just like the scales often pictured on this card, generosity has two sides. This card shows when you are the person expressing generosity, or when you are the recipient of someone else's good favor.

								<div class="meaning">The Seven of Pentacles shows those times when a choice must be made between keeping what you have and trying to get more. This is probably the most overtly dualistic of the Pentacles cards and, as befits the nature of the suit, both choices can seem lucrative at different times and in different circumstances. On one hand, we have the conservative viewpoint of not taking risks and keeping what you have. There is also the option of going out and getting more wealth, but at the risk of losing it all. The decision is so difficult because neither option is largely preferable to the other, and both are supported by the Pentacles nature.

									The Eight of Pentacles is the first card of its suit to touch explicity on the spiritual realm, though it does so briefly and in certain circumstances only. Most of the time it refers to a time of hard work and dedication on the material realm, in the hopes of improving your work and yourself at the same time. Unlike the Three, which shows a rewarding and expressive career, the work shown on the Eight often goes without reward until the very end. But once that end is finally reached, the rewards are often unimaginable; they transcend the material realm.

									Nine is a number of perfection and completion; the Nine of Pentacles shows both of these, in both the material and spiritual realms. Though primarily a materialistic card, as all the Pentacles are, it does bear a spiritual side as well. A lifetime of work and refinement brings not only material rewards, but wisdom and satisfaction as well. Abundance in material wealth leads to abundance in emotion, and that leads eventually to abundance in spirit. This relationship is reversible too, for through spiritual development we gain the means to become even richer.

									One of the great problems with having wealth is what exactly to do with it, and this is the central concept of the Ten of Pentacles. All of the positive traits of the Pentacles suit are embodied here; security, happiness, and the spiritual wisdom that comes with experience in the real world. Like the rest of the Tens, the Ten of Pentacles reminds us that we have learned important lessons through the other suit cards, and now we are challenged to apply them to the problem at hand. So now that you have all the wealth you need and all the happiness you want... what do you do?

									The Page of Pentacles is the most responsible of the Pages, a trait which is shared by all the Pentacles court cards because of their Earth nature. The fact that someone so young can be so down-to-earth and ready to accept great responsibility is a rare event, and a Page of Pentacles in your midst is a rare and welcome sight. Though he may only be concerned with the immediate benefits of wealth, the Page still manages it far better than the majority of adults do. He can appear, like the other Pages, in one of three ways. He can be an event, a person in your life, or a part of your own personality.

									As an event, the Knight of Pentacles often shows a time when you will have to assume responsibility and take charge of a situation. You could be assigned a project or given a task to do, and you will have to devote some of your time to see that project end successfully. Perhaps the responsibility will not be due to a new project, but an old failure that you have to account for. In either case, stand tall and accept responsibility without any complaints or manipulations. The Knight of Pentacles has the strongest body of all the Knights, as well as the strongest character. In situations like the ones he represents, the latter is often more useful

									The Queen of Pentacles is a card in which the energy of a Major Arcanum is reproduced, but on a more accessible level. She is like a mirror of the Empress in that she is a Queen of fertility and harvest, and her talents extend to mothering and nurturing as well. The only thing she really lacks that the Empress possesses is the ability to create life, but the Queen of Pentacles makes up for that with her ability to sustain and care for all kinds of life. She is materially wealthy, but even that is superseded by the wealth she has build through kindness and generosity. She manifests in your life as either a person or a part of yourself.

This is the logical conclusion of all the positive ideals of the Pentacles suit: through diligence, responsibility and attention to detail we can and will become like the King of Pentacles. He is always rich materially if not spiritually, and he encourages you to live your life like he would. When this card appears he can either represent a person in your life, or a part of yourself trying to be expressed.

								<div class="meaning">In the right hands, the sword is a powerful weapon that can serve the needs of justice and authority. But the sword cuts both ways, and when in the posession of those who seek to use it for evil, its power becomes wholly negative. Every Sword card in the Tarot bears the duality but the Ace is particularly susceptible to it. It is the beginning, the spark of potential that will influence all that lies ahead. The Sword by itself can never be positive or negative. The bearer of the sword determines whether he will wield it with clarity and truth of purpose, or with anger and agression.

								<div class="meaning">
									The inherent duality of the Swords suit is shown here as the delicate balance of the two swords. The Two of Swords expresses this balance as a stalemate, a conflict between two equally matched forces in which neither has the clear advantage. These forces can take on many forms: negative against positive, the impulse to act against the desire to stay silent, or knowing what to do against actually doing it. Such impasses are not easily resolved, and they can lead to a long period of confusion and stagnation. So we have peace, but in this situation peace is detrimental

The Three of Swords is a dark gem that has many faces, none of which are particularly pleasant. There is rejection, sadness, loneliness, heartbreak, betrayal, separation and grief. Such events feel so painful because we don't expect them, and the Three of Swords often serves as a warning sign to show when one or more of these is possible. By preparing for it, the emotional blow can be lessened or even prevented entirely. But that is not the main lesson here.

									In a suit filled with strife and obstacles, the calm serenity of the Four of Swords seems somewhat out of place. This is because the Swords suit deals mainly with the negative and agressive uses of the inherent power of the sword symbol, while the Four is the only card that deals with its positive aspects of peace and mental clarity. The Four of Swords shows a period of rest and recovery after a time of challenge, with the promise that, once recovered, you will return to the challenge. In the meantime, the Four of Swords provides a tough new challenge - the challenge to stay silent.

The image on the Rider-Waite and its many variants is that of a victorious man and two defeated opponents, and in this symbolism we see more of the typical duality of the Swords suit. When this card appears it usually means that you are defeated - cheated out of victory by a vily and cunning opponent. But sometimes you are that victor, the one who has defeated your opponents through the use of your mind. Whether the victory was an ethical one remains to be seen.

Sometimes the only way to solve life's problems is to leave them, go someplace new and start over. Though such a retreat can seem cowardly and even illogical (which would violate the Swords ideal of honesty and mental clarity) it is often the only approach left when all others have failed. After times of dreadful confusion and strife, the Six of Swords shows you that the only way to escape the turbulent waters of our emotions may be to leave them behind.

Such cunning and confidence are two of the hallmarks of the Seven of Swords, as it stands for those times when guile and diplomacy will bring about the results that brute force will not. But the Seven of Swords has that same double edge as the rest of the cards in its suit, and thus it implies that you can be the victim of such deception.

									The Eight of Swords shows what happens when you abuse the power of the Swords suit to a large enough degree - it turns against you. In most cases, the Eight of Swords and its precarious position of entrapment is the end result. Your mental clarity is replaced by blindness, your arms are tied and you feel unable to move out of the situation. And if you tried to move, you would likely impale yourself on the ring of Swords. The twisted web of logic and mental power is a tough one to escape, but it can be done by someone who realizes that the Swords can be used to his or her advantage.

									It is one of the many paradoxes of human nature that a bed can both make you secure and release your inner fears to haunt you. The night often holds your greatest fears and terrors, including nightmares like the one which has woken the woman on the Nine of Swords. This card rules regret, anxiety and all the other things that make you sit in bed at all hours of the night, afraid to close your eyes and go back to sleep. Unlike the pain of the Three of Swords, which is caused by an exterior event, the Nine of Swords is a realm of inner anguish. You can run away from exterior pain, but you cannot hide from that which burns within you.

									All they that take the sword, it has been said, shall perish with the sword, and the Ten of Swords is a card that show us the real-life implications of this proverb. This is the ultimate manifestation of the Swords suit and its negative, destructive power. Even though only one sword would be needed to kill this man, ten were used: he has not simply been killed, but annihilated. The Ace of Swords was a warning about using excessive force for evil purposes and the Ten is the inevitable result of that abuse of power. Those who refuse to listen to the wisdom of the Swords will eventually be impaled on them.

									The Page of Swords has the mental outlook and philosophy of a child, and he is constantly fascinated with matters of the mind. This is not to imply by any means that he is childish and immature; indeed, he is probably the most mature and mentally developed of the four Pages. He may not realize his full power at the moment, but he knows how to use what he has discovered to the best of his ability. Like all the Pages, the Page of Swords will manifest in your life either as an event, another person or as a part of yourself that needs to be awakened.

									When the diplomacy of the Page of Swords fails to achieve results, the Knight will try it his way, the violent way. Violence in this sense does not refer to physical brutality but to a suddenness and apparent hostility that will threaten most people. And if they do not feel threatened they will almost certainly feel a little wary around the Knight of Swords. He is the essence of the element of Air, almost completely removed from the realm of emotion, and all that is associated with him must be perceived accordingly. He can manifest in the typical three ways: as an event, as a person in your life, or as a part of yourself.

									The Queen of Swords is another of those mysteriously ambiguous court cards in which the masculine and the feminine are at conflict. She never shows her emotional side, but her judgement can sometimes be swayed by her heart, and because of these conflicts she is neither a good confidante nor a fair judge. The Greek myth of Atalanta comes to mind when viewing this card (and not just because Atalanta is the Queen of Swords in the Mythic Tarot!). Atalanta was a woman who lived to the standards of men, and who would not accept the love of any man except one would could defeat her in battle. When someone did beat her, their love was squandered and destroyed

									The best judge of them all is the King of Swords, because he can take any situation, look at it with total impartiality, and then render a decision that is both fair and insightful. He has powerful emotions, much more so than the other Swords court cards, but he keeps them under control and uses them for the best possible purposes. The King of Swords is the figurehead of government, law, administration and all the duties associated with his suit. In the majority of cases he appears in your life as another person, though sometimes he is a part of yourself that must be brought to the surface.

The Ace of Cups is the initial flow of emotion that could become a mighty river is given time and attention. It is the planted - but still dormant - seed of great love and affection in the future, the first stirrings of passion, joy and insight. The Cup on this Ace is often said to represent the Holy Grail, and just as Joseph of Arimathea was sustained by the wafer placed in the Grail each day, so too does love and emotional balance sustain our everyday lives.

									By its image, the Two of Cups almost always suggests a relationship between two people. Indeed, this is the primary meaning of the card and the one that appears most often in readings. But the love described by this card is not always love for another person. Before we can truly love another we must learn to love ourselves, to love and accept all of the different (and often conflicting) facets of the gemstone that makes up our personality. Like the Temperance card, this is a card of harmonious union, not just of two people, but of two parts of the same person.

The figures pictured on the Three of Cups are always joyful, celebrating some success together, and thus the card shows us that happy times spent in the company of our friends and loved one become even happier, while sad times become a little less sad. This is one of the many powers of the group, and the community as a whole, that are explored through the card called the Three of Cups.

									Pleasure in excess often leads to the stagnation of that pleasure and the desire for even greater things which are simply impossible. This is the lesson of the Four of Cups, a card that urges moderation in relationships and all matters of the heart. This is an apparently good and innocent card with a nasty sting lying in wait. Usually it signals a person who is surrounded by love and devotion, totally happy with himself and the life he has made. But the danger in this situation is this: if you take love for granted, you start losing it.

This is a card whose meanings are quite simple: sadness, grief, disappointment and regret. Often these feelings will arise because of actions such as those pictured on the Four of Cups; taking love for granted and not valuing every person or thing in our lives that make us feel special. The Four predicted that all would be lost if nothing was taken to divert the path of events, and when this advice is not heeded, the Five of Cups becomes the inevitable result.

After losses such as those on the Five we sometimes have to take a time out to heal, to look back on the past and all the good that lies there. And during such times it's never the right thing to focus on the negative, and that's why this card is so positive and full of light. The fallen cups are now full and upright again, but with blooming flowers that cannot be spilled or washed away. Now that you have looked back, maybe now the way will be clear to look forward.

The seven cups are filled with strange and wonderful gifts... but there is always danger hidden within one or two of them to sting anyone who ventures near. Lying amidst the gems and the wreath of victory are a snake and a dragon. Sometimes you have to choose between many options, all of which may be tempting but only one of which is the best choice. At others times not all of those choices are real options at all; they are delusions of the imagination.

									It is appropriate that the figure on the Rider-Waite Eight of Cups is walking near a marsh or pool, because a stagnant swamp is the best symbol for the emotional stagnation portrayed here. This happens when the flow of energy and love that pushes us forward stops, and when you simply start drifting through life on the placid ocean, waiting for the wind to return. In such times, waiting is usually not the best solution because it is unlikely that anything will get done if you just sit there. This is one of those times when you might just have to break out the paddles and row.

One of the most positive and uplifting cards of the entire deck, the Nine of Cups shows satisfaction on all levels - emotional, physical, sensual. It is little wonder that most Tarot readers refer to this as the Wish Card, and its appearance is often taken as a sign that, whatever your heart's desire is, it shall be granted in the coming days. It may not be granted exactly as you expected but you can rest assured that you will get what you want.

Perhaps it is because, like the Page of Cups, they have never been taught to suppress their innate emotional and intuitive power. The Page of Cups is a person whose imagination is totally free, free to dream wonderful dreams and to create his life exactly as he chooses. But although his head is in the clouds, his feet rarely leave the ground. When his energy enters your life it manifests in one of three ways: as a person around you, as an event that you will experience, or as a part of yourself that you must bring into full manifestation.

Indeed, the Knight of Cups is the most feminine of his group of four, though that does not mean by any definition that he is any less of a Knight. He is in touch with his intuition and emotions, and he uses them for his own good during his quests of romance and seduction. He can manifest as an event, a person in your life, or as a part of yourself.

								<div class="meaning">
									No intuition is more powerful than that of the Queen of Cups. She is the pure force of Water, and her connection with the subconscious is rivalled only by the High Priestess. She is often like a mirror, reflecting the hidden depths of others back to them, so they can see their own mysteries for themselves. However, her cup is closed, and her own secrets remain invisible to all, even to herself sometimes. Such is the paradox and fluidity of the Water element. Hardly ever manifesting as an event, the Queen of Cups is almost always found either in people near you, or in yourself.

									The King of Cups is a strangely ambivalent figure. Such a powerful male form seems almost out of place amidst the element of Water, just as the Queen of Wands is somewhat uncomfortable in the realm of Fire. This is why the King of Cups is often seen as a card of contradictions. He represents someone who is calm on the surface, yet passionate and volatile underneath. He shows a situation that is not entirely what is appears to be at first glance. Under his facetious exterior the King of Cups hides ulterior motives. He can be found in our lives as another person or as a facet of our own personality.
